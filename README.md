# Dynamic Array Demo in Java

This project demonstrates basic array operations in Java, including dynamic initialization, iteration using both standard and enhanced `for` loops, and random number generation with `Math.random`.

## Features

- 📦 Array creation and initialization
- 🔁 Iteration using `for` and enhanced `for` loops
- 🎲 Random number generation to populate array elements
- 📊 Simple output of array contents

## Code Highlights

- Uses `Math.random()` to fill an array with random values
- Demonstrates both traditional `for` loop and enhanced `for-each` loop
- Shows how to work with arrays dynamically based on size
